This project is a display of what I have learned in my object oriented programming course.
It is built with an MVC framework in mind. 
Front end is built off of Angular,
Back end is built off of dontnet core.
There is Authorization, Authentification, Dependency Injection, MVC frameworks, SPA.
(It is missing ORM) I my efforts have taught you something.
Have an awesome day!# OOP-FINAL
