# OOP-FINAL

Adrian Gonzalez

This project is a display of what I have learned in my object oriented programming course.
It is built with an MVC framework in mind. 
Front end is built off of Angular,
Back end is built off of dontnet core.
There is (no Authorization), Authentification, Dependency Injection, MVC frameworks, SPA, (no ORM).
If my efforts have taught you something I'm elated.
Have an awesome day!
